# Mathematical Modelling of Football
This repository holds all the work I completed for the Mathematical Modelling of Football
[course](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1RT001) at Uppsala University, which took place from September to 
October 2023. The course, instructed by David Sumpter, is worth 5 master's credits and is conducted remotely. The course
web page with all the lessons can be found [here](https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
