# Mathematical Modelling of Football
This repository holds all the work I completed for the Mathematical Modelling of Football
[course](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1RT001) at Uppsala University, which took place from September to 
October 2023. The course, instructed by David Sumpter, is worth 5 master's credits and is conducted remotely.


## Setup
1. After cloning the repo, create the environment:
    ```commandline
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
2. Clone the Statsbomb repository inside the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data.git Statsbomb
    ```
3. Create a `Wyscout/` folder and store data downloaded from 
[here](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/5) inside it.
